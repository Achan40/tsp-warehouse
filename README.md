# tsp-warehouse
This project is my attempt at a real-world application of the traveling salesman problem. 

In a warehouse, workers must retrieve a number of products and devliver them to a docking bay. The traveling salesperson problem (TSP) asks the question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?". I believe that the TSP almost exactly describes the issues a warehouse faces on a daily basis, we can apply its solutions to speed up efficenty in real business operations.
